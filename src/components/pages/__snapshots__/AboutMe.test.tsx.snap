          A few facts about myself
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I love traveling. Especially with my family. We have explored several unforgetable places and hopefully many more will follow.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am a sports enthusiast, although, unfortunatelly, as a viewer. I love Tennis and Basketball the most, but during big events such as the Olympics or the World Cup, I watch everything there is.
          </li>
          <li>
            I love food. Both making and eating. This is really a weakness of mine, and I'm paying for that with a horrible BMI rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            I love coffee - can't live without it. I usually drink 5-6 cups a day, with a mixture of cappucinno, black Turkish and my favorite - double espresso.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am a fan of TV shows, watching quite a few on Netflix and other platforms. Among the best I've watched are: 'Better Call Soul', 'Dark', 'Bron', 'Breaking Bad', 'Fargo', 'Narcos' and others

            I made quite a few turn arounds during my proffessional career. First I was in love with image processing. Then with elecro-optics, specifically with optical design, but now I feel that I found what I was looking for all this time - software.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having the experience and a broader look of the makes me a better programmer. I guess that it's called maturity, and I found, that it is a required asset in our industry.
          </li>
          <li>
            I really am into good coding practices. I watched many lectures of SW world icons as 'Uncle Bob', Martin Fowler, Linus Torvalds, Guido Van-Rossum, Kevlin Henney, Raymond Hettinger and others. I also have read several books regarding this subject, amongs them 'Clean Code' by Bob Martin and 'Refactoring' by Martin Fowler.
          </li>
          <li>
            I understand that learning is not enough. In order to become profficient and comfortable with new and existing technologies, you have to practice, and practice a lot. The same as we expect our pilots, phisicians and repair-men to be experts, so must we. I found that except practicing and getting better all the time in our daily work, there are other great platforms like excersism.io, freeCodeCamp, Medium, youtube and others.
          </li>
          <li>
            One thing that I'm still postponing, hopefully not for long, is taking part in an open source code project. It should be really awesome, and I can't wait to get to it rather sooner than later.

          Recommended Books
        </h3>
        <p>
          Since we are already into speaking about programming, here are a few great books that I have read and can recommend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disclosure 1: I'm not getting anything out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disclosure 2: I didn't read all the content of all of these books. Sometimes I jump back and forth, depending of my current interests.
